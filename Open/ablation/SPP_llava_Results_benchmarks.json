The algorithm works by starting at node 0 and iteratively visiting the node with the lowest total distance from the starting node.\n\nWe begin by assigning a distance of 0 to node 0, and a distance of infinity (\u221e) to all other nodes. We then create a priority queue of nodes sorted by their distance from the starting node. We add node 0 to the queue with a distance of 0.\n\nNext, we pop the node with the lowest distance from the starting node (in this case, node 0) from the priority queue. We then visit that node and update the distances of its neighbors by adding the distance from the starting node to the distance from the current node. If the distance to a neighbor is already less than or equal to the current distance, we do not update it.\n\nWe repeat this process until we reach node 6. The path we take is the sequence of nodes we visit in the order they are popped from the priority queue.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 6 as follows:\n\n1. Pop node 0 from the queue with a distance of 0.\n2. Update the distances of its neighbors: node 1 with a distance of 3, node 2 with a distance of 4, node 3 with a distance of 7, and node 4 with a distance of 9.\n3. Pop node 1 from the queue with a distance of 3.\n4. Update the distances of its neighbors: node 2 with a distance of 7, node 3 with a distance of 10, and node 4 with a distance of 12.\n5. Pop node 2 from the queue with a distance of 7.\n6. Update the distances of its neighbors: node 3 with a distance of 13, and node 4 with a distance of 15.\n7. Pop node 3 from the queue with a distance of 13.\n8. Update the distances of its neighbors: node 4 with a distance of 18.\n9. Pop node 4 from the queue with a distance of 18.\n10.

The algorithm works by starting at the source node (0) and iteratively visiting the node with the lowest distance from the source node.\n\nWe can represent the graph as an adjacency list, where each node is represented by a list of its neighbors and their respective distances. We initialize the distances for all nodes to infinity, except for the source node, which we set to 0.\n\nWe start by marking the source node (0) as visited and setting its distance to 0. Then, we iterate through the neighbors of the source node, and for each neighbor, we check if it has been visited before. If it has not been visited, we mark it as visited, set its distance to the sum of the distance from the source node and the distance from the source node to the neighbor, and add it to the unvisited neighbors list.\n\nWe repeat this process until we reach the destination node (11). At this point, the path from the source node to the destination node is the sequence of nodes visited in the order they were visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 11 in this graph.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>\n{'Path': '0->10->4->7->1', 'TotalDistance': '10'}\n</final_answer>\n</root>"], ["ER:  \nThe Shortest Path Problem (SPP) involves finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.\nYou need to find the shortest path between node 0 and node 11 in a graph.

Then, we add an edge from node 0 to node 1 with a weight of 15, which is the distance between the two nodes. Next, we iterate through the graph, considering the edges with the lowest total distance from the current node.

Therefore, we choose the edge from node 1 to node 2, as it has the lowest total distance.\n\nWe repeat this process until we reach node 12. The total distance of the shortest path is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path.
