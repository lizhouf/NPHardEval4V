However, since we are given the graph's edges and weights, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path.\nThe Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the distances of all nodes from the source node (in this case, node 0) until it detects that the algorithm has found a cycle in the graph. Once a cycle is detected, the algorithm stops and returns the shortest path.\nTo use the Bellman-Ford algorithm, we first need to compute the distance of all nodes from node 0. We can do this by using a priority queue to store the nodes and their distances, and then computing the distance of each node using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.\nOnce we have computed the distance of all nodes, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 9. The Dijkstra's algorithm works by starting at node 0 and finding the shortest path to each node in the graph, and then updating the shortest path to node 0 based on the shortest path to each node.\nThe final shortest path from node 0 to node 9 is: 0->4->7->9\nThe total distance of the path is: 11 + 12 + 3 + 10 + 5 + 12 + 10 + 5 = 67\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>\n{ 'Path': '0->4->7->9', 'TotalDistance': '67' }\n</final_answer>\n</root>\n</example1>"]]]], [["<example1>\n<root>\n<reasoning>\nTo find the shortest path from node 0 to node 9, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or any other algorithm that finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
