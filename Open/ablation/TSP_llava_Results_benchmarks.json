The total distance at this point is 11.77.\n\nNext, we visit City 3, which is connected to City 0, City 2, and City 4. The distance between City 0 and City 3 is 5.0, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 16.77.\n\nWe then visit City 4, which is connected to City 0, City 3, and City 5. The distance between City 0 and City 4 is 5.0, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 21.77.\n\nNext, we visit City 5, which is connected to City 0, City 4, and City 6. The distance between City 0 and City 5 is 5.0, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 26.77.\n\nWe then visit City 6, which is connected to City 0, City 5, and City 7. The distance between City 0 and City 6 is 6.71, so we add this distance to the total distance.

The distance between City 0 and City 7 is 4.0, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 37.48.\n\nWe then visit City 8, which is connected to City 0, City 7, and City 9. The distance between City 0 and City 8 is 6.08, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 43.56.\n\nNext, we visit City 9, which is connected to City 0, City 8, and City 10. The distance between City 0 and City 9 is 2.83, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 46.39.\n\nWe then visit City 10, which is connected to City 0, City 9, and City 11. The distance between City 0 and City 10 is 4.12, so we add this distance to the total distance. The total distance at this point is 50.51.\n\nFinally, we visit City 11, which is connected to City 0, City 10, and City 11. The distance between City 0 and City 11 is 3.16, so we add this distance to the total distance.
